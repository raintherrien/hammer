/*
 * This tectonic uplift simulation is loosely based upon:
 *   Lauri Viitanen, Physically Based Terrain Generation: Procedural Heightmap
 *   Generation Using Plate Tectonics, 2012.
 *   http://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:amk-201204023993
 *
 * I settled on something that resembles the outlined program structure for
 * clarity when referring back to the paper, however I have not attempted to
 * recreate the solution described. The objective of Viitanen's thesis was to
 * model the process of plate tectonics, whereas my goal is to approximate the
 * result of plate tectonics.
 *
 * Quite a few aspects of the described program structure stuck out as odd to
 * me when I first read the paper, such as left/top based coordinates, which I
 * typically associate with GUIs and window managers. After some experimenting
 * I realized why this was done and it does make much more sense.
 *
 * However, this program grew organically through a combination of
 * experimentation and skimming the source paper. Notable differences include:
 *
 * - I assume crust age in the paper was a density modifier, however it does
 *   not go in depth about implementation. I omitted it when drafting a
 *   prototype and never went back to implement it.
 *   TODO: eventually I would like to add this back in, to feed rock types to
 *         later stages of the pipeline for a little variety.
 *
 * - My preliminary attempts used only map data at the lithosphere level,
 *   where during each step when plates were moved around data was translated
 *   from a front buffer to a back-buffer. In retrospect, this obviously does
 *   not work if you want to have information about plates currently
 *   overlapping, and that's half the point of a tectonic sim! Otherwise all
 *   boundaries are at most ||velocity|| wide, which would only kind of work
 *   at very low resolutions. We must keep an elevation map per plate like the
 *   program structure described in the paper.
 *
 *   However, the paper seems to imply each plate map is only as large as the
 *   plate (width x height). This is a clever way to save memory, but all the
 *   allocations involved with growing or moving a plate, as well as the
 *   bookkeeping to determine which direction a plate is growing, made me veer
 *   in a different direction. I would much rather eat the 6-8MiB/plate (most
 *   of which is wasted, yes) and give each plate its own map the size of our
 *   world.
 *
 * - I did not implement velocity as a translation + rotation matrix because
 *   my decision above makes it impossible to practically determine the center
 *   of a plate. I don't find the results lacking enough to deal with the
 *   complexity mentioned above.
 *
 * - I use a fixed map size for simplicity. This allows us to use uint32_t
 *   where the paper uses size_t. Any use of this tectonic map is going to be
 *   blurred and interpolated to shit anyway so this is plenty of detail for
 *   me. This also allows us to define our arrays with a constant size rather
 *   than rely on nested allocations, which is just nice and will compile
 *   better if we keep size a power of two (no modulo).
 *
 * - Certain features, like friction and physics between plates I experimented
 *   with but didn't find the complexity worthwhile.
 *
 * - I handle collisions very inefficiently but this part of the paper makes
 *   no sense to me. This can be worked around with collision list ordering
 *   and memoization and I'm happy enough with it.
